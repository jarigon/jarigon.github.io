<p> My topic is gun control.  The reason I chose this topic is because as of right now guns are a serious problem in America.  As of right now there are school shootings so often it has basically become a common occurence.  Without any changes to these laws and without extensively digging into the issue this problem might never go away and kids everywhere will always be afraid to go to school.</p>
<p> I used illustrator to make almost everything in this project.  I used it to make the logo in the bottom right, made the little bubbles for the text, warped most of the text and vectorized most of the items in the image.  I did use photoshop to mess with the photo of the gun being handed over as well as the gun in the logo and some of the text, like on the bottom left was also photoshop.</p>
